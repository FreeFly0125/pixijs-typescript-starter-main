## Requirements
- Node JS (v18+) with NPM

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development (VS Code)

Launch the `Complete development` launch configuration.

Putting/removing breakpoints in the `.ts` files with VS Code in `/src` should work.
If it does not, please open an issue.

Edit the TypeScript files, the browser should refresh on save.

## Development (Terminal)

You can also start the development server by executing the following script within the repo:
```bash

npm install

npm run dev
```

You should then see the starter on http://localhost:3000/
